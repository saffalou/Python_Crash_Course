# python does not have to have an else block, the else block is optional

# With this change, every block of code must pass a specific test in order to be executed. 
# The else block is a catchall statement. 
# It matches any condition that wasnâ€™t matched by a specific if or elif test, 
# and that can sometimes include invalid or even malicious data
