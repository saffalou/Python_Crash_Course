# A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. 
# Each key is connected to a value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key. 
# A keyâ€™s value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary. 
# In fact, you can use any object that you can create in Python as a value in a dictionary. 
# In Python, a dictionary is wrapped in braces ({}) with a series of key-value pairs inside the braces
# A key-value pair is a set of values associated with each other. 
# When you provide a key, Python returns the value associated with that key. 
# Every key is connected to its value by a colon, and individual key-value pairs are separated by commas. 
# You can store as many key-value pairs as you want in a dictionary.

# now we add new items to the dictionary
